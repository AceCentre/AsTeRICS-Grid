## Remote control (Infrared)

The following tutorial explains how to create a remote control for a TV by sending Infrared commands to Open Source microcontroller [Puck.js](https://www.puck-js.com/), which supports emitting infrared light codes out of the box. The commands can be directly copied from [puckmote](https://asterics.github.io/puckmote/) (online remote control database).

1. Get a [Puck.js](https://www.puck-js.com) device (**not Puck.js Lite**) from the [official shop](https://shop.espruino.com/puckjs) or [another distributor](http://www.espruino.com/Order).
2. Follow the [Puck.js Getting Started Guide](https://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start+BLE#puckjs)
3. Enable Bluetooth on your host device
4. Check if your device is contained in the [puckmote database](https://asterics.github.io/puckmote/).
5. Test infrared command of choice, e.g. click on ```Power On``` or ```On```.
