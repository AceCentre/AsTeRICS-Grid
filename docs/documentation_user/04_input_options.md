# Input Options
This chapter is about how grid elements can be selected with different input modalities.

[Back to Overview](README.md)

Clicking on Button "Input Options" in [Main view](02_navigation.md#main-view) opens a menu with the following entries:
* **Mouse/Touch input:** options for input types like normal mouse click, tap or hovering
* **Scanning:** Input method for 1-2 input events, subsequently select groups of elements until one element is chosen
* **Direction input:** Input method for 2-5 input events, 1-4 input events for navigating in different directions, 1 input event for selecting an element
* **Huffman input:** 2-9 input events, assigns a code to each grid element which consists of an ordered sequence of the available input events
* **Sequential input:** 2 input events, one for navigating to the next element one for selecting the current element

## Input events
An input event in general is any kind of defined, single user interaction. AsTeRICS Grid currently supports the following input event types:
* **Keypress:** event of pressing a key on the keyboard, also can be a external button press using additional external hardware
* **AsTeRICS ARE event:** any event that is generated by a running model within the AsTeRICS Framework. This type of event is very flexible and can be e.g. eye movement, head movement or a signal of an EMG muscle activity sensor.

These types of input events can be used in all input methods except *Mouse/Touch input* where the input events are mouse movements and click/tap events.

### Keypress input events
Figure 1 shows the configuration possibilities of an keypress event:

![input event keypress options](./img/input_channel_keyboard_en.jpg)
*Fig. 1: Configuration of a keypress input event*

These are the shown elements and options:
1. **Dropdown**: allows to choose between *Keypress* or *AsTeRICS ARE* event 
1. **Record key**: click in order to start keyboard record mode. A subsequent keypress on the keyboard will be recorded and that key used for the event. 
1. **Current key**: prints the currently recorded/used key. *Digit1* means the `1` digit key on the keyboard. 
1. **More**: a accordion of additional options that can be opened/closed by a click 
1. **Timeout**: minimum pause in milliseconds between two subsequent actions (if faster, the second action is ignored). Mandatory if different *Repetitions* are set for the same key in order to wait for possible upcoming repetitions before performing the action.
1. **Repetitions**: the number of times the key has to be pressed in order to perform the action 
1. **Hold duration**: time in milliseconds how long a key has to be pressed in order to perform the action 

Note that it's not possible to set both *Repetitions* greater 1 and *Hold duration* greater 0 at the same time.

#### Usage examples
Here are some examples for the properties *Timeout*, *Repetitions* and *Hold duration* that could be useful in real use cases:
* **Different actions with same key (e.g. Space), distinction by hold duration:**
    * **Action 1**: Timeout=0, Repetitions=1, Hold Duration=0
    * **Action 2**: Timeout=0, Repetitions=1, Hold Duration=400
    * Pressing the key once performs action 1, Pressing and holding the key for 400ms performs action 2
    * This is the default configuration for input method *Scanning* where this configuration can be tested
* **Different actions with same key (e.g. Space), distinction by repetition:**
  * **Action 1**: Timeout=0, Repetitions=1, Hold Duration=0
  * **Action 2**: Timeout=300, Repetitions=2, Hold Duration=0
  * Pressing the key once and waiting 300ms performs action 1, pressing the key twice (with less than 300ms pause) performs action 2
* **Filter unintended keypresses**
  * **all actions**: Timeout=0, Repetitions=1, Hold Duration=300
  * any unintended keypresses are ignored and actions are only performed if a key is pressed longer than 300ms

### AsTeRICS ARE input events
AsTeRICS ARE input events are triggered by external events of a running [model](01_terms.md#asterics-model) within the [AsTeRICS Framework](01_terms.md#asterics-framework).

![input event asterics are options](./img/input_channel_are_en.jpg)
*Fig. 1: Configuration of an AsTeRICS ARE input event*

Figure 1 shows the configuration of an AsTeRICS ARE input event:
1. **Dropdown**: allows to choose between *Keypress* or *AsTeRICS ARE* event 
1. **Record ARE event**: start recording of AsTeRICS ARE events. Subsequently trigger the desired event in ARE in order to be recorded.
1. **ARE URL**: the URL of the running AsTeRICS instance. If AsTeRICS ARE is running on the same computer this field can be empty.
1. **List of events**: list of recorded ARE events. Any of these events triggers the currently configured action.
1. **Recycle bin symbols**: a click on the recycle bin symbol next to a recorded event deletes it

#### Example of using an AsTeRICS ARE event
Follow these steps in order to set up an AsTeRICS Grid input method while using AsTeRICS ARE event for input:
1. Open the settings modal for the desired input method in AsTeRICS Grid
1. Start AsTeRICS ARE
1. Select *AsTeRICS ARE event* for the desired input action in AsTeRICS Grid
1. Click on "Record ARE event" to start recording
1. Do any action in AsTeRICS ARE that tiggers an event, e.g. clicking on a button
1. The recorded event should be shown in AsTeRICS Grid
1. Save and close the input options in AsTeRICS Grid by clicking "OK"
1. Redo the same action in AsTeRICS ARE as before - it should trigger the configured input action in AsTeRICS Grid

## Scanning options
If scanning is enabled there are several additional options for this input method:

![input options](./img/scanning_options_en.jpg)

1. **Vertical scanning** defines the direction of scanning:
    * **vertical** (checked): groups are built vertical, moving left to right <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="./img/scanning_vertical.gif" alt="vertical scanning" width="130"/></div>
    * **horizontal** (unchecked): groups are built horizontal, moving top to bottom <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="./img/scanning_horizontal.gif" alt="horizontal scanning" width="130" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>
1. **Binary scanning** defines if scanning groups are rows/columns or one half of existing elements:
    * **binary** (checked): groups are built by separating remaining elements in two halves each scanning step <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="./img/scanning_binary.gif" alt="binary scanning" width="130"/></div>
    * **horizontal** (unchecked): groups are built row/column by row/column <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="./img/scanning_non_binary.gif" alt="non-binary scanning" width="130" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>
1. **Scanning Time**: time to wait between two scanning steps (in milliseconds)
1. **Time factor first element**: the time to keep the first scanning group (e.g. first row/column) highlighted is "Scanning Time" multiplied with this factor. Increasing the time for the first group often improves usability.
1. **Scanning keyboard key**: defines which key of the keyboard is used to select the currently highlighted scanning group (default: Space). To change press "Record other key" and press the desired key afterwards.
1. **Scanning ARE events**: makes it possible to select the current scanning group by any event from the [AsTeRICS Framework](01_terms.md#asterics-framework). Set it up this way:
    * Start the AsTeRICS Framework (ARE) with the desired model (e.g. a model generating an event when moving the head)
    * Click on "Record ARE Events" in AsTeRICS Grid
    * Trigger the desired event in the running model (AsTeRICS Framework), e.g. move the head
    * recored events are now listed in the AsTeRICS Grid input configuration, press OK in order to apply the changes
    * Scanning groups now can be selected by triggering the recorded event in the AsTeRICS Framework (e.g. moving the head)
