# Translation of AsTeRICS Grid

AsTeRICS Grid supports multiple application- (user interface-) languages and communication grid languages. 
The standard gridset is already available in several languages, and the number of supported languages for the application user interface is constantly growing as well!
In order to change the application or grid language, choose "Settings" and select the Application Language or Grid Content Language.

# Creating a new Translation

There are generally two possibilities for a translation to other/new languages:

## 1) Translation of the app itself (the captions, user interface etc.), this works via
https://crowdin.com/project/asterics-grid
 -> Create a user/log in, select the language and click on "Translate all", see: https://i.imgur.com/ObujrTU.png

## 2) Translation of the content:

AsTeRICS Grid can offer multilingual as well as monolingual standard gridsets (templates that can be imported).
The current template is multilingual, but many templates will be monolingual because there are often linguistic/cultural differences,
which are not only reflected in other words, but also in other images or other structure of the grid elements. 
So the question is, if you want to translate the current default (multilingual) gridset or if you want to create your own gridset for their language. 

### translate current default gridset:
* create a new offline user so that nothing else is changed in the grids.
* Use "Edit -> more -> Translate grid" to translate all grids to the target language, like shown in the video
* Create a backup with the new language via "Manage grids -> more -> Export backup as file*  send it to Benjamin Klaus and he will add it as new default gridset

### create new default gridset with own language only:
* Set the correct content language under "Settings", see https://i.imgur.com/NpfMnsD.png
* Adjust configuration as you like, how it works best for the desired language 
  can also be something completely different than the current standard gridset
* "Manage grids -> More -> save custom data to file" and here select, see: https://i.imgur.com/TepacgZ.png
* Send the file to office@asterics-foundation.org and we can offer it as new default gridset!

Translation of the standard gridset is also described in this video:

(use auto-translation of subtitles, as this is a german video)
