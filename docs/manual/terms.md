## AsTeRICS Grid
Web-based application for AAC solutions, runs in the browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer, mobile Browsers).

## Grid element
A grid element is part of a grid and normally consists of a label and/or an image. Selecting a grid element normally triggers an action, e.g. navigating to another grid.

There are 3 types of grid elements:

1. **Normal**: an element consisting of a label and/or an image
1. **Collect element**: an element that collects the labels of previously selected elements and therefore makes it possible to construct e.g. sentences out of single word elements.
1. **Prediction element**: an element that is dynamically filled up with word predictions based on previously selected normal elements.

## Action
An action that is performed if a grid element is selected, e.g. navigate to another grid, speak some text or some external action like turning on a light.

## Input
