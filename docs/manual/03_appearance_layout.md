This chapter is about a grid's layout and appearance and how to edit it.

## Adding elements and layout options
In the [Edit view](02_navigation.md#edit-view) the following menu opens on a click on "More":

*Fig. 1: Edit view - menu "More"*

These are the actions to select in the menu:

1. **New &#x2192; New Element**: creates a normal new element, opening a dialog where label and image can be defined
1. **New &#x2192; Many new elements**: creates multiple new normal elements at once, opening a dialog where multiple elements can be defined and inserted into the grid
1. **New &#x2192; New collect element**: creates a new collect element, see [Terms](01_terms.md#grid-element)
1. **New &#x2192; New prediction element**: creates a new prediction element, see [Terms](01_terms.md#grid-element)
1. **Delete all elements**: removes all grid elements from the grid
1. **Add row to layout**: adds a new row to the grid layout, e.g. creating a new third row for elements at the bottom in Figure 2 <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="img/add_row.gif" alt="add row" width="130" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>
1. **Remove row from layout**: removes the last row from the grid layout while keeping all grid elements. Applied to Figure 2 this would mean that afterwards there is only a single row where all six elements are placed. <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="img/remove_row.gif" alt="remove row" width="130" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>
1. **Fill gaps**: moves all grid elements as far left as possible, closing gaps. Applied to Figure 2 this would result in moving "Food" to the left, closing the gap between "Food" and "Clothing". <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="img/fill_gaps.gif" alt="fill gaps" width="130" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>

## Editing grid elements
A right click (or long tap) on a grid element in edit view opens the following menu:

![edit view - element menu](img/edit_element_menu_en.jpg)
*Fig. 2: Grid element menu*

These are the options to select:

1. **Edit**: opens a dialog to edit the label and the image of this element
1. **Actions**: opens a dialog to edit actions that should be performed if this element is selected, see [Grid actions](actions.md)
1. **Delete**: deletes this element
1. **More &#x2192; Duplicate**: inserts a copy of this element to the grid
1. **More &#x2192; Do element action**: performs the actions that are assigned to this grid element, e.g. speaking the label or navigating to another grid

## Edit modal
Clicking on "Edit" in the grid element menu (Fig. 2) opens this modal, Figure 3:

*Fig. 3: Edit grid element modal*

These are the elements in the modal of Figure 3:

1. **Label**: change the label of the element shown under the image, can be empty
1. **Choose file**: opens a file dialog to choose a different image
1. **Clear image**: deletes the currently chosen image
1. **Image preview**: shows a small preview of the currently chosen image
1. **Drop area**: drag and drop image files in this area to select them. It's possible to drag and drop files from a file explorer or also other programs like e.g. METACOM MetaSearch*. <div style="margin-left: 2em"><img src="img/drag_metacom.gif" alt="fill gaps" width="600" style="margin-left: 2em"/></div>
