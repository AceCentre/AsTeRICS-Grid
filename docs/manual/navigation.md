1. **Register now:** choose this option in order to sign up for an online user, which makes it possible to synchronize the grids across devices.

See [Terms](terms.md#User) for more information about offline/online users.

## Main view
Once taken a decision in the welcome view AsTeRICS Grid subsequently starts in the "main view" which looks like this (desktop view on the left, mobile view on the right):
