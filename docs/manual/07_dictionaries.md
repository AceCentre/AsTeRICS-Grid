[Back to Overview](00_index.md)

A dictionary is a collection of words and their relations that is saved within AsTeRICS Grid in order to fill [prediction elements](01_terms.md#grid-element). 

## Edit dictionaries
The basic functionality of the manage dictionaries view was already described in chapter [navigation and basic functionality](02_navigation.md).

In the manage dictionaries view clicking on "Edit" in the list of dictionaries allows to see the details of a dictionary and editing it.
