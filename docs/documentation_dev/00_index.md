# AsTeRICS Grid developer documentation

This is the developer documentation for AsTeRICS Grid, a web-based tool for augmented and alternative communication (AAC) with integration of the AsTeRICS Framework.
For clarification of used terms see chapter [Terms](../documentation_user/01_terms.md) of the user documentation.

The following docs do not include interface documentation about all Javascript modules and their public methods. They can be found in (surely not always perfect) [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) format in the [AsTeRICS Grid sources](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/tree/master/src/js).
