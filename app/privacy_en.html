<div>
    In this declaration we inform you about the most important aspects of data processing in AsTeRICS Grid.
    If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the AsTeRICS Foundation: <a
        href="mailto:office@asterics-foundation.org"> office@asterics-foundation.org </a>
</div>
<h2>Processing of data</h2>
<div>
    AsTeRICS Grid is a web application for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The application can be
    individually
    adapted to the needs of users. There are 2 ways to use AsTeRICS Grid, with each the data is stored in different ways.
    <h3>Offline users</h3>
    <div>
        In the case of an offline user, all personalized data is only stored locally on the user's device
        and cannot be viewed or processed by any other people.
    </div>
    <h3> Online user </h3>
    <div>
        <p>For an online user, all personalized data is stored in a database of the
            AsTeRICS Foundation and therefore can be accessed and
            be synchronized on multiple devices of the user. However, all personal data is encrypted end-to-end. This
            means that only the user himself can see it unencrypted. The AsTeRICS Foundation has no
            possibility to access or process personal data, which is saved within the user configuration.
            The key for encrypting the data is the self-chosen user password. For encryption the
            <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"> algorithm AES </a>
            and the <a href="https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl"> software library sjcl </a> is used.
        </p>
        <p> The following data can be found in the AsTeRICS Foundation database without having the decryption keys: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Username</strong>: the freely selectable username is stored unencrypted. It is only
                used to identify the user account. The username is the only data record that possibly can be linked to a
                person.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Number of grids</strong>: although all content is encrypted, it's possible to see the number
                of grids a user has created.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3> Access analysis </h3>
    <div>
        For AsTeRICS Grid we use access analysis from <a href="https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo">Matomo</a>.
        All data collected in this way is stored on our own servers, will not be passed to third parties and cannot be
        linked to individual persons. The following data is saved:
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymized IP addresses of the users (the last 2 bytes are deleted)</li>
            <li>Count and duration of access</li>
            <li>Operating system, browser version and screen resolution used for access</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<h2>Use of YouTube</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        As soon as a video is started in the built-in YouTube player, cookies are created by YouTube.
        If you want to use the built-in YouTube player, you have to agree to the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank">YouTube Terms of Use</a> and the
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google privacy policy</a>.
        All YouTube search queries are sent to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3"
                                                      target="_blank">YouTube Data API</a>
        in order to receive and show appropriate search results.
    </p>
</div>
<h2>Legal basis</h2>
<div>
    The legal basis for the usage of the username (the only personal data processed by AsTeRICS Grid) is consent,
    since when registering for an online user a the corresponding tick has to be set.
</div>
<h2> Data transfer </h2>
<div>
    No data is transferred to third parties.
</div>
<h2> Storage period </h2>
<div>
    All user data of online users will be deleted after 365 days without use (no login by the user).
    If an online user should be deleted beforehand, this can be done by sending a request to
    <a href="mailto:office@asterics-foundation.org">office@asterics-foundation.org</a>.
